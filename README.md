# SEED Reimplementation

This is the reimplementatin of the ICLR'20 paper: [Inductive and Usupervised Representation Learning on Graph Structured Objects](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkem91rtDB).

## Introduction

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised graph representation learning model named SEED. SEED contains two major steps 1) random walk with WEAVE encoding and 2) encoder and decoder training.

In this implementation, the random walk and WEAVE is pre-obtained and saved as the prior dataset. The encoder and decoder associated with the identity kernel is implemented.

## Running the code

There are only one .py file as a demo for MUTAG dataset.
